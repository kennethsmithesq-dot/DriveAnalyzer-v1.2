Harmonic Drive Analyzer V1.2

Drive Analyzer is a tool for analysing musical events (chords/notes) in an xml music score; it searches for common chord configurations (triads / sevenths etc). It shows results in a grid and can export PDF output. It is a useful method of analysing 20th century art-music in the western tradition, which, through its tonal complexity, often obscures diatonic drive. It may, however, have other uses.
The method of musical analysis – “drive analysis” – is explained at www.chromatic-harmony.com/drive-analyzer.html and complements Kenneth Smith’s book, Desire in Chromatic Harmony (OUP, 2020).
As an advanced feature, the program further allows users to track “entropy” across the course of a piece as described in the article, “The Enigma of Entropy in Extended Tonality” (Music Theory Spectrum 43, no. 1, 2021).

The programme takes the form of a single executable file, and the downloadable zip bundles contain a manual.pdf file and  a foler of xml sample files.
